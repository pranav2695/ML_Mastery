## Assumption of Linear Regression
1. Linearity: Relationship between independent variable $(x)$ and dependent variable $(y)$ must be linear. we can check this using the scatter plot. we should be seeing the random cloud of data points. we will see the U shaped or curved data point then it is voilating the assumption. we can fix this by doing the transformation like log, $x^2, x^3$  
    - we can create the Residual vs Fitted plot in which x-axis will have the predicted values $y^{hat}$ vs residuals which is $y^i-y^{hat}$. if this plot show the random clouds of points then we are able to capture all the underline pattern in the data if not then we were not able to capture the curve of the data.
    - why we plot the $y^{hat}$, because we summarize all the input variables into the single variable, instead of having 20 plots for individual variable we use one variable to check the model wise performance.
2. Homoscedasticity (Constant variance) : The spead of the residuals should be constant, it should not increase or decrease as we move from left to right. If does changes then its standard error and p value is not reliable.
    - we can check
