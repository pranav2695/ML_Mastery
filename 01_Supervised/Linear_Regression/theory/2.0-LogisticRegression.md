## Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression in a way is the extension of linear regression, using the thresholds we can classify into classes which is called decision boundry.
$g(z) = 1/1 + e^{-z}$  
$z = f_{w,b}(x)$ 
- Cost function of logistic regression is not same as used for the linear regression because it will be non convex function for logistinc regression due to that it will sucked into one of the local minima.
  
  $L(f_{w,b}(x^i, y^i)) = -y^ilog(f_{w,b}(x^i))-(1-y^i)(log(1-f_{w,b}(x^i)))$
- overfitting/underfitting : when the model is not very good fit of the model then it is called underfitting, they have high bias. when the model fit the data too well which learning the noise also then it is called overfitting, model have high variance.
- Technique to solve the issue of overfitting  
    1. Collect more training data 
    2. select the feature, this is called feature selection
